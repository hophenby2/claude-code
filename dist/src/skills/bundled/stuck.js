const STUCK_PROMPT = `# /stuck \u2014 diagnose frozen/slow Claude Code sessions

The user thinks another Claude Code session on this machine is frozen, stuck, or very slow. Investigate and post a report to #claude-code-feedback.

## What to look for

Scan for other Claude Code processes (excluding the current one \u2014 PID is in \`process.pid\` but for shell commands just exclude the PID you see running this prompt). Process names are typically \`claude\` (installed) or \`cli\` (native dev build).

Signs of a stuck session:
- **High CPU (\u226590%) sustained** \u2014 likely an infinite loop. Sample twice, 1-2s apart, to confirm it's not a transient spike.
- **Process state \`D\` (uninterruptible sleep)** \u2014 often an I/O hang. The \`state\` column in \`ps\` output; first character matters (ignore modifiers like \`+\`, \`s\`, \`<\`).
- **Process state \`T\` (stopped)** \u2014 user probably hit Ctrl+Z by accident.
- **Process state \`Z\` (zombie)** \u2014 parent isn't reaping.
- **Very high RSS (\u22654GB)** \u2014 possible memory leak making the session sluggish.
- **Stuck child process** \u2014 a hung \`git\`, \`node\`, or shell subprocess can freeze the parent. Check \`pgrep -lP <pid>\` for each session.

## Investigation steps

1. **List all Claude Code processes** (macOS/Linux):
   \`\`\`
   ps -axo pid=,pcpu=,rss=,etime=,state=,comm=,command= | grep -E '(claude|cli)' | grep -v grep
   \`\`\`
   Filter to rows where \`comm\` is \`claude\` or (\`cli\` AND the command path contains "claude").

2. **For anything suspicious**, gather more context:
   - Child processes: \`pgrep -lP <pid>\`
   - If high CPU: sample again after 1-2s to confirm it's sustained
   - If a child looks hung (e.g., a git command), note its full command line with \`ps -p <child_pid> -o command=\`
   - Check the session's debug log if you can infer the session ID: \`~/.claude/debug/<session-id>.txt\` (the last few hundred lines often show what it was doing before hanging)

3. **Consider a stack dump** for a truly frozen process (advanced, optional):
   - macOS: \`sample <pid> 3\` gives a 3-second native stack sample
   - This is big \u2014 only grab it if the process is clearly hung and you want to know *why*

## Report

**Only post to Slack if you actually found something stuck.** If every session looks healthy, tell the user that directly \u2014 do not post an all-clear to the channel.

If you did find a stuck/slow session, post to **#claude-code-feedback** (channel ID: \`C07VBSHV7EV\`) using the Slack MCP tool. Use ToolSearch to find \`slack_send_message\` if it's not already loaded.

**Use a two-message structure** to keep the channel scannable:

1. **Top-level message** \u2014 one short line: hostname, Claude Code version, and a terse symptom (e.g. "session PID 12345 pegged at 100% CPU for 10min" or "git subprocess hung in D state"). No code blocks, no details.
2. **Thread reply** \u2014 the full diagnostic dump. Pass the top-level message's \`ts\` as \`thread_ts\`. Include:
   - PID, CPU%, RSS, state, uptime, command line, child processes
   - Your diagnosis of what's likely wrong
   - Relevant debug log tail or \`sample\` output if you captured it

If Slack MCP isn't available, format the report as a message the user can copy-paste into #claude-code-feedback (and let them know to thread the details themselves).

## Notes
- Don't kill or signal any processes \u2014 this is diagnostic only.
- If the user gave an argument (e.g., a specific PID or symptom), focus there first.
