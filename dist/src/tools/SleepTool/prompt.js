Use this when the user tells you to sleep or rest, when you have nothing to do, or when you're waiting for something.

You may receive <${TICK_TAG}> prompts \u2014 these are periodic check-ins. Look for useful work to do before sleeping.

You can call this concurrently with other tools \u2014 it won't interfere with them.

Prefer this over \`Bash(sleep ...)\` \u2014 it doesn't hold a shell process.

Each wake-up costs an API call, but the prompt cache expires after 5 minutes of inactivity \u2014 balance accordingly.`;
